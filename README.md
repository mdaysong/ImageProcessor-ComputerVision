# Image Processor
 
Created a general image processor that can demosaic RGB images, detect edges and identify vanishing points

Implemented linear interpolation for image demosaicing, image filtering with Laplacian of a Gaussian filter, random image noise generation, Hough transform algorithm for vanishing point detection
